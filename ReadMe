This package provides the following modificaitons to the VenusOS GUI:
    move Settings and Notifications to the top of the list man page
    hides the Tiles Overview
    enhances the Mobile Overview
        all new layout and tile organization
        add Inverter Only mode
        shows voltages current and frequency for AC in and out
        shows current for DC loads
        shows solar voltage and current
        hides Pump switch if not enabled to make more space for tanks
            (this became standard in v2.70~9)
        tanks column scrolls if there are more tanks than space allows
        add temeratore sensors to tanks column
            The tanks column is split into separte columns for tanks and temerature sensors
            A common tile height is set for both columns, then each column is filled in separtly
            Any tank that apepars as a dBus temperature sensor should appear
    enhances the Tank Tile
        red indicates low/high fluid levels
        indicates NO RESPONSE if no signal received from tank
        tile shrinks if needed to show more tanks, then list scrolls
        display custom tank names (stock in v2.70~9)
        displays absolute fluid quantity (e.g., gallons) in addition to percentage
    enhances the Flow Overview
        adds tank information to the flow Overview
            4 tanks fit along the bottom of the page
            for more than 4 tanks, the list scrolls
        adds AC voltage, current, frequency and input current limit to flow Overview
        adds power gauges to AC In, AC Out and Inverter tiles
        adds power gauge to PV Charger tile
        adds power gauge to battery that shows both charge and discharge level
        adds inverter mode (Off, On, Inv (Invert Only), Ch (Charge Only)) to the switch area in the inverter tile
        adds popups for AC input current limit and inverter mode
        adds presets for AC current limits, plus a "spinner" to adjust new value between presets
        inverter popup has colored buttons to help select the desired mode
        add temps information
            A combination of up to 4 tanks and temps fit across the bottom
            For more, the bottom row splits into separate rows for temps and tanks
            Each row scrolls horizontally if more than 4 items exist in the row
    
each of these modifications can be selected individually at install time

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

The buttons for the popups are hidden and the touchable area is kept to a minimum
    to avoid confusion with activating the bottom menu bar and swiping to other overviews
The AC input current limit popup is activated by touching the lower third of the AC Input tile
The Inverter mode popup is activated by touching the middle of the Multi tile

The power gauges require additional information during installation.
    The first three values can be taken from the spec sheet for your specific Multi/Quatro, etc.
    The inverter's peak power provides a maximum displayable value.
        Use the value at which the inverter will continue to run only for a short period of time.
            For some inverters, this value is double the continuous value,
                so you may wish to set this to a lower value in order to favor more space
                to display lower values.
    The inverter's maximum continuous power sets the overload threshold.
        The intent is to show the power at which the inverter will run forever
        at least if ambient temperature is within reason.
        This value should be set to the inverer's maximum output power spec at 25 C.        
    The inverter's caution level indicates a power level at which the user should start
            looking at system power in order to prevent an overload.
        Set this parameter to something like the maximum power spec at highest temperature.
    The maximum system power is the point at which the components down stream will overload.
        For example, this could be set to the power equivalent to the power distribution panel's
        ain breaker (e.g., 50 amps on a 120volt system would be 6000 watts).
        This parameter is optional. Setting it allows the AC output gauge to show an overload
            at this value rather than the sum of input and inverter powers (power assist).
        If you do not want this limitation, set the value to 0.
    The maximum PV Charger power is the maximum power expected from all PV charger arrays.

Configuration:
    Each set of modificaions can be enabled/disabled separately during installation
    For the power gauges, you must also specify a set of power limits
        The spec sheet for the inverter is a good guide for these
        Caution level defines level at which the inverter may have difficulty supplying that much power
            The inverter's max power under the most adverse contitions is a recommended value
        Maxium continuous power is the power the inverter can sustain under best conditions
        Peak power is the inverter's peak power capability.
            This number is often twice the max continuous so you may want to choose a lower value
        Maximum output power is generally defined by the master breaker in the distribution panel.
            For example, set this parameter to 3600 for a 30 amp main breaker for a 120 volt system.
        Maximum battery bank discharge current is the continuous current based on the battery specs.
            Factor in the number of batteries in parallel.
            For example, set this to 400 for 4 100 AH batteries in parallel.
    For the AC input current limit presets, enter the desired value for each preset.
        A value of 0 disables that preset.

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper,
then use its package install tool. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.

There are two other methods to fetch a package archive.

IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/GuiMods/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data

If the Venus device does not have internet access, you will need to fetch the archive using a computer that does have internet access:

click on this link in a web browser:
https://github.com/kwindrem/GuiMods/archive/current.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.
When Venus boots, it will unarchive the file to /data/GuiMods-current

Move the directory into it's active locaiton:
rm -rf /data/GuiMods
mv /data/GuiMods-current /data/GuiMods

Repeat the above for SetupHelper if you haven't done so for another package.

Finally, run the setup script to complete the installation
/data/GuiMods/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
